# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Prototype dashboard

A standalone HTML prototype for branch and task management lives in `docs/index.html`.

- Open it locally by loading `docs/index.html` in your browser.
- When GitHub Pages is configured to publish the `docs` folder, the prototype is served from:

  `https://<username>.github.io/Panelty-Portal/`

  *(note: the `/docs` prefix is not part of the public URL)*
