# **App Name**: Branch Compliance Tracker

## Core Features:

- Violation Logging: Allow authorized users to log municipal violations, linking each to the relevant branch. Users should be able to choose the operational region, brand, and branch, auto-filling branch information after selection.
- Objection Logging: Enable the recording and tracking of challenges to logged violations. After choosing a branch, show associated violations and facilitate the submission of supporting documents and final decisions.
- Task Tracking: Capture operational tickets for branches with priority, category and SLA, automatically routing to relevant managers.
- Branch Management: Provide a centralized system to manage branch information, including name, city, operational region, brand, manager name, regional manager name, and location link. This data should then auto-populate across the whole app, removing redundant typing.
- KPI Recording: Store and chart sales, orders and other KPIs per branch for quick performance reviews.
- Reporting Dashboard: Produce analytics dashboards with visualizations of municipal compliance infractions
- Role-Based Access Control: Control user access and permissions within the platform, with preset roles like Quality Officer, Regional Manager, Branch Manager, Upper Management, and System Admin.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#79BAEC), conveying reliability and organization.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#468C8C), offering contrast and drawing attention to important actions.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body, supplemented with 'Source Code Pro' for any code snippets. This pairing makes the design look modern but not overly busy.
- Use simple, professional icons to represent different violation types and branch locations. Prefer open-source icon sets
- Employ a clean, tab-based layout for the primary pages. Use well-structured forms with clear labels.
- Use subtle transitions when filtering data or when an action is completed, so that the app feels polished but without distracting or tiring the user
